# Balls Shuffling Starting Flutter Project

The provided code is a Flutter application for a "Ball Shuffle" project. It consists of a single screen (HomeScreen) where users can tap a button to change the displayed image of a ball randomly.The application provides a simple "Ask Me Anything" experience, where users can tap the button to shuffle the displayed ball randomly. Each time the button is pressed, a random ball image is shown.
The chngimage method is responsible for generating a random number and updating the ball variable with the corresponding image path. This triggers a rebuild of the widget, resulting in the updated ball image being displayed.
In the build method of HomeScreen, the UI is constructed using Flutter widgets. It includes a background color, a text widget displaying "Ask Me Anything...", an image widget showing the ball image, and an elevated button labeled "Ask" that triggers the chngimage method when pressed.
